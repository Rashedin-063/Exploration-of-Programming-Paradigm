# All YAML files (regardless of their association with Ansible or not) can optionally begin with --- and end with .... This is part of the YAML format and indicates the start and end of a document.

# All members of a list are lines beginning at the same indentation level starting with a "- " (a dash and a space):

---
# A list of tasty fruits
- Apple
- Orange
- Strawberry
- Mango
...

# A dictionary is represented in a simple key: value form (the colon must be followed by a space):

# An employee record

# These are called “Flow collections”.

# Ansible doesn’t really use these too much, but you can also specify a boolean value (true/false) in several forms:

# Use lowercase ‘true’ or ‘false’ for boolean values in dictionaries if you want to be compatible with default yamllint options.

create_key: true
needs_agent: false
knows_oop: True
likes_emacs: TRUE
uses_cvs: false


# Values can span multiple lines using | or >. Spanning multiple lines using a “Literal Block Scalar” | will include the newlines and any trailing spaces. Using a “Folded Block Scalar” > will fold newlines to spaces; it is used to make what would otherwise be a very long line easier to read and edit. In either case the indentation will be ignored. Examples are:

include_newlines: |
            exactly as you see
            will appear these three
            lines of poetry

fold_newlines: >
            this is really a
            single line of text
